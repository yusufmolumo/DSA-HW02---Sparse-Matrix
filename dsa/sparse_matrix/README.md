# Sparse Matrix Operations

## Programming Assignment 2: Sparse Matrix

### Task Description:
Using any programming language of your choice, load two sparse matrices from input files and perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on them.

## Features
- Reads sparse matrices from input files
- Supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication of sparse matrices
- Writes the resulting matrix to an output file
- Handles whitespace and invalid input gracefully

## Requirements
- Python compiler (interpreter): depending on your machine specifications, `python` or `python3` is required for this program.
- Use `python --version` to check the version of Python on your machine.

## How to Use
